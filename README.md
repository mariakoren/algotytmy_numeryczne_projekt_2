# Algorytmy Numeryczne, project 

This project was a task for the university subject "Algorytmy Numeryczne".

The task was to implement a random walk with the Monte Carlo method.
The next part was to implement a matrix describing this walk.

Also implemented 3 algorithms for solving equations: 
1) Gaussian method
2) Gaussian method with partial selection of the basic element
3) Gauss-seidel method

Moreover verifying some hypothesis connecting with their algorithms.


Doing together with [@matdomino](https://github.com/matdomino).
